ACK: Actinic Keratosis
BCC: Basal Cell Carcinoma
MEL: Melanoma
NEV: Nevus
SCC: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SEK: Seborrheic Keratosis

Actinic Keratosis (ACK) is a precancerous skin condition caused by long-term exposure to the sun. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) are both types of skin cancer, with BCC being the most common type. Melanoma (MEL) is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body and is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Nevus (NEV) refers to a pigmented lesion on the skin, commonly known as a mole. Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK) is a benign skin growth that often appears as a waxy or wart-like lesion.
All BCC, SCC, and MEL are biopsy-proven. The remaining ones may have clinical diagnosis according to a consensus of a group of dermatologists. In total, approximately 58% of the samples in this dataset are biopsy-proven. This information is described in the metadata.
