ACK: Actinic Keratosis
BCC: Basal Cell Carcinoma
MEL: Melanoma
NEV: Nevus
SCC: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SEK: Seborrheic Keratosis

Actinic Keratosis (ACK) is a precancerous skin condition caused by long-term exposure to the sun. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) are both types of skin cancer, with BCC being the most common type. Melanoma (MEL) is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body and is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Nevus (NEV) refers to a pigmented lesion on the skin, commonly known as a mole. Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK) is a benign skin growth that often appears as a waxy or wart-like lesion.
All BCC, SCC, and MEL are biopsy-proven. The remaining ones may have clinical diagnosis according to a consensus of a group of dermatologists. In total, approximately 58% of the samples in this dataset are biopsy-proven. This information is described in the metadata.


# Is there some missing data? Are there images of low quality? Etc

From the metadata one can see, that some cells are empty. We can't say why this happend, but we can assume that people didn't want to give permission on gathering of a specific data.


# You can select a small (e.g. 100) subset images to focus on at the start. The only requirement is that there are at least two categories of images.
