ACK: Actinic Keratosis
BCC: Basal Cell Carcinoma
MEL: Melanoma
NEV: Nevus
SCC: Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SEK: Seborrheic Keratosis

Actinic Keratosis (ACK) is a precancerous skin condition caused by long-term exposure to the sun. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) are both types of skin cancer, with BCC being the most common type. Melanoma (MEL) is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body and is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Nevus (NEV) refers to a pigmented lesion on the skin, commonly known as a mole. Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK) is a benign skin growth that often appears as a waxy or wart-like lesion.
All BCC, SCC, and MEL are biopsy-proven. The remaining ones may have clinical diagnosis according to a consensus of a group of dermatologists. In total, approximately 58% of the samples in this dataset are biopsy-proven. This information is described in the metadata. 

These medical abbreviations relate to skin conditions and skin cancers. Some of these skin conditions are benign (not cancerous), such as NEV (Nevus) and SEK (Seborrheic Keratosis), while others are malignant (cancerous), such as BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma), SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma), and MEL (Melanoma). ACK (Actinic Keratosis), on the other hand, is a precancerous condition that has the potential to develop into skin cancer if left untreated. All of these conditions can be related to sun exposure, which is a significant risk factor for skin cancer development.
